# Docker Utilities Repository

This repository contains a collection of quick-to-spin-up Docker applications designed to perform various utility functions. Each application is organized into its own directory and includes a `docker-compose.yml` file and any necessary configuration or source code files to facilitate easy setup and deployment.

## Intent of the Repository

The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of useful, easily deployable Docker applications that serve various purposes. Each application is self-contained, making it easy to explore, modify, and deploy independently. As new Docker utilities are developed, they will be added as separate directories under this repository.

## Usage

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-util-apps.git
cd docker-util-apps
```

### Running an Application

Each utility is located in its own directory within the root of the repository. To run any of the applications:

1. **Navigate to the desired applicationâ€™s directory**:

```
cd [app-directory]
```

2. **Start the application using Docker Compose**:

```
docker compose up -d
```

3. **Access the application** according to the documentation provided in each application's `README.md`.

### Stopping an Application

To stop any application, navigate to its directory and run:

```
docker compose down
```

This will stop and remove the running containers for that specific application.

## Current Applications

### 1. Logger Application (`/logger`)

The logger application is a simple, containerized logging service built using **Express.js** and **MongoDB**. It is designed to demonstrate how to set up a basic logging system with minimal configuration. The application consists of two services:

- **Express API**: An Express.js server that exposes RESTful endpoints to handle logging entries.
- **MongoDB**: A MongoDB container that stores the log entries created via the API.

## Future Applications

As more utilities are developed, they will be added as separate directories within this repository. Each utility will have its own dedicated sub-directory, documentation, and configuration files to keep the repository organized.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests. The intention is to expand this collection with more useful Docker utilities over time.

### Contribution Guidelines

1. Each new utility should be placed in its own directory.
2. Include a `README.md` file in each sub-directory that explains the purpose, setup, and usage of the specific utility.
3. Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` files are well-documented and easy to understand.
